Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and Livestock Commission ' s Average All Pigs Price in February , which represents hedging for over 13 , 000 pigs , more than twice the number cash - settled in January , the LMFE said . Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was introduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the futures market to farmers , abattoirs and users of meat would increase because of the absence of a delivery requirement .

Pay ' N Pak said that the proposal from a leveraged buyout firm had been amended to increase the dividend rate on the cumulative preferred stock to be received by PNP shareholders from 13 . 5 pct to 17 . 5 pct . As previoiusly announced , the proposal calls for a transaction in which PNP shareholders would receive a combination of 17 . 50 dlrs in cash and 2 . 50 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative preferred stock for each common share . Under the other proposal received from Paul Bilzerian , PNP shareholders would receive on a blended basis 16 . 67 dlrs in cash and 3 . 33 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock for each common share , the company said . Under the Bilzerian proposal , the dividend rate on the preferred stock would be set so that in the joint opinion of the financial advisor to Bilzerian and the financial advisor to Pay ' N Pak , the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation value on a fully distributed basis , the company said ., AI Mark: 2.71%, Label: Human generated\n",

This view is less favourable than the West German government ' s forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year , but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1 . 5 to two pct . The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year , with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms . The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future .

      "Text: LUCAS SEES CONTINUED GROWTH IN SECOND HALF Lucas Industries Plc & lt ; LUCS . L > said its underlying performance would continue to improve in the second half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U . K . Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North American electronics . The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax profit to 40 mln in the six months to end - January . The figure was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped sharply to 557 . 5p at 1130 GMT from last night ' s close of 590p . It said it would continue with plans for all its activities to be internationally competitive and profitable . Costs of restructuring , reorganisation , employee training and retraining , particularly in the UK automotive businesses , together with high research and development spending would affect profits in the short term .

GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson , presenting his budget for fiscal 1987 / 88 to parliament , said U . K . Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987 . He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2 . 5 billion stg , after a 1 . 1 billion shortfall in 1986 . Inflation is expected to be 4 . 0 pct at the end of 1987 , he said , adding it may exceed 4 . 5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4 . 0 pct by the end of the year . The planned PSBR for 1987 / 88 was 4 . 0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986 / 87 , Lawson said . Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply , Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate ., AI Mark: 95.47%, Label: Human generated\n"
